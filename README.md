# Customer-Characterization-Tool

Created during CRA Internship.

Given a set of consumer data (excel file) + product name/labelling file (excel), it will output multiple files labelling each customer based on their consumption habits (top 5 most consumed product categories), stores with the greatest amount of visits, as well as the top 5 time periods they purchase. 

When presented in a Data Visualization Software like Tableau, it will clearly categorize each type of customer, thus allowing companies to make marketing more personalized to each consumer.
