# Customer-Characterization-Tool

Created during CRA Internship.

Given a set of consumer data (excel file) + product name/labelling file (excel), it will output multiple files labelling each customer based on their consumption habits (top 5 most consumed product categories), store locations, and time of purchase. Over a period of time, there will be enough data to indicate the consumption pattern of a consumer.

When presented in a Data Visualization Software like Tableau, it can also categorize customers into clusters, thus allowing companies to make marketing more personalized to each consumer group.
